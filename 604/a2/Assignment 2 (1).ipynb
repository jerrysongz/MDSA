We will be using a table generated by Statistics Canada (2022), based upon census data, about the knowledge of languages by area in Canada. This table has been pre-cleaned (although potentially not entirely) so that you can work on the actual assignment more quickly.\n",

I had learned SQL in my undergrad days, but after that class, I never used SQL again, and in this assignment, I used SQL again after a few years, although I think I quickly recalled what I had learned in the past, such as basic syntax and basic SQL operations. But the complex concept of JOIN confused me. For example, in the last two questions of part B, I couldn't think of a solution that could be solved without using JOIN TABLE. So I found some SQL information on the Internet, which made me understand the concept of JOIN Table again. So after some practice, I solved the last two problems of part B by using JOIN method. And I used the JOIN method to solve my own problem in part C later on."
