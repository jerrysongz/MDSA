    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime isn't a topic most people want to use mental energy to think about. We want to avoid harm, protect our loved ones, and hold on to what we claim is ours. So how do we remain vigilant without digging too deep into the filth that is crime? Data, of course. The focus of our study is to explore possible trends between crime and communities in the city of Calgary. Our purpose is visualize Calgary criminal behaviour in order to help increase awareness for both citizens and law enforcement. Through the use of our visuals, individuals can make more informed decisions to improve the overall safety of their lives. Some of the main concerns of the study include: how crime rates increase with population, which areas in Calgary have the most crime, and if crime adheres to time-sensative patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset of interest is called Community Crime Statistics, and it's under the domain of the City of Calgary Police server. The domain provides information on the type of reported crimes dating back from January 1, 2012 to September 18, 2018. The crime statistics and Calgary shapefile datasets were obtained from the Open Calgary public data portal. Permission to use the data is obtained through consenting to the terms of use under this license https://data.calgary.ca/d/Open-Data-Terms/u45n-7awa. The dataset format provides information about the crime type, date, frequency of crime, resident count, sector and neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Community information is tabulated through the columns Sector, Community Name, and Resident Count. \n",
    "The Sector column describes the quadrant that the neighborhood is situated in. Community Name provides the location as to where the incident occurred. These locations are also in the form of longitude and latitude coordinates, which indicate the center point of each community. Resident Count is the number of citizens residing in a community; a value obtained from the Civic Census of that year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Criminal activity is described in the Crime Count, Date, ID, and Category columns. Date indicates the first day of that month and year when the incident occurred. Additionally, month and year data can be found in the columns Month and Year. Category types include: Assault (non-domestic), Commercial Break & Enter, Commercial Robbery, Physical Disorder, Residential Break & Enter, Social Disorder, Street Robbery, Theft FROM Vehicle, Theft OF Vehicle, Violence ‘Other’ (Non-domestic). Crime Count is based on the most serious violation per incident. (Open Calgary, 2018, online)\n",

    "## Guiding Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding questions proposed for this study were generated with the generalization that civilians and law enforcement will find the data useful for their own purposes. In respect to residents, the visuals may aid in their decision about the community they want to move to or continue to reside in. They may also want additional insight regarding criminal behaviour in the city, over time. From this insight, they can take proper precautionary measures by learning what kinds of crime frequently occur in their area. Alternatively, police may find the data useful in preventing crimes by studying the trends of areas with denser crime activities and the change in crime rates over time. The following are our guiding questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "** 1.\tHow does the crime distribution change over time? **\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a pattern of crime over certain time periods, then it may benefit police to study said pattern. If crime rates increase during certain time periods, then law enforcement may want alter officer schedules to counteract those trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2.\tWhat’s the frequency of the crimes by category? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting the frequency of certain crime types may prepare residents and police to better responds during certain crises. Studying crime types may expose if there are more an increase of activity or variety in certain areas during different times such as deteriorating economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 3.\tIs the amount of crime affected by population? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Showing the crime rate (crime per resident) by neighbourhood can help evaluate the risk for individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 4.\tHow is crime distributed throughout the city? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting the trend by community helps residents monitor the safety of their neighbourhood and allows police to allocate resources to deteriorating communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our guiding questions, we will use Python within the Jupyter notebook environment to create visualizations of the dataset. The main software libraries we’ll be importing are Geopandas, Pandas and Matplotlib. Because the dataset provided has been pre-cleaned by the source, minimum cleaning will be required.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our analysis, we observed that the overall crime rate slightly increased from 2012 to 2017, but there was a big spike in the crime rate in 2016. This can be attributed to the worst period of the recent recession. A similar trend was observed for each city sector. City center and East sectors consistently displayed the highest crime rates.\n",
    "Also, we demonstrated that the crime rate increases over the warm months with some crimes showing an additional spike in the month of October. The monthly crime rates vary from year to year but every year between 2012 to 2017 follows the same pattern. This pattern hold for almost all city sectors, despite the significant difference in the absolute crime rate among these sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the citizens' perspective, this information can help remind that in economic downturns they need to be more cautious and vigilant when it comes to crime. It can also help to highlight the City center and East sectors as riskier parts of the city, and that the warmer months of the year can be more trouble-prone. By looking at specific sectors, citizens can increase their awareness of surrounding communities. \n",
    "From the Police's perspective, this information can help add more resources to the City center and East sectors and put more forces out in the street over the warmer months of the year. It can also help the police to budget for more resources in economic downturns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, crime increases with population but does not respond as quickly to slight population changes. Whereas crime is distributed unevenly among the city where Centre has the majority of reported crimes followed by East and Northeast. The communities with the highest level of crime consistently maintain that reputation, regardless of what happens year after year, and communities with low to moderate levels of crime continue to fluctuate within those levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be interesting to combine the data with traffic flow, temperature and census data to study other correlations. Traffic flow may provide better insight on the amount of people travelling through sectors and provide patterns of crime. Temperature data will assist to confirm if warmer months warrant more crime. Census data will be interesting to study to see the distribution of age and people in each sector. "
